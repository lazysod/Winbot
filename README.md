IRC Channel Manager Collection
============

While on IRC chatrooms I used the "Winbot IRC Client" In short a bot that runs on windows. 

##Disclaimer##

I am not responsible for this script breaking or blowing up your server - got it?

##Usage:##
1. Download the bot client from http://winbot.org/?page=Download
2. Read the readme foles for the bot (get the basics and set up your account ect...) 
3. Copy the winbot files to the winbot folder you installed it to and load the scripts you want to run
4. START THEM - Then configure as you like. 

Some of the scripts are channel management files, some are really just for fun and entertainment. 

Enjoy
